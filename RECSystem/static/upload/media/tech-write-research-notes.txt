Chest X-Ray Annotation Optimisation Model Using Weighted Boxes Fusion

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
===== INTRODUCTION =====
Hello, good day! I am one of the researchers, my name Julieza 
Raper, I am going introduce to you our research topic. This research 
talks about optimizing the chest-xray annotation by different radiologist
using the WBF Model, or Weighted Boxes Fusion. The methodology will be
discussed by Mr. Karl Bersamin, the results and discussion as well as the 
demonstation will be tackled by our research leader, Ms. Kyla Shitan. 

In introducing our topic, I would like to give description, what is 
Chext Xray, ...

* Chest Xray is 
	-> hardest medical data to analyse
	-> challenging due to superimposition of anatomical structures
	  can make it very difficult to detect abnormalities.
	-> area of research interest since 1960s
	-> The potential of the automation of CXR analysis could mean 
	  better efficiency and accuracy of Chest X-Ray impressions.

* And, the objective or goal
	-> of this study, as the researchers, we took on the challenge 
	of the possibility of being able to optimise the tedious 
	process of annotating Chest X-Rays to provide medical experts
	with the best annotations, thus being able to conclude 
	an accurate impression/ accurate chest xray results.
	- To achieve the possibility of optimising the 
	annotation of Chest X-Rays, we, the researchers will be comparing
	4 models and able to analyze them, and identify which model 
	outperformed the other models in optimizing CXray annotations.

with that, my co-researchers will be discussed further about
the methodology (nxt person pls).

* Weighted Boxes Fusion 
	- a novel method for combining predictions of object detections 
          models

===== METHODOLOGY (Experimental Research Methodology) =====

* Meaning
	-  Dataset is the VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities
	-  There are repeated annotations and overlapping of an XRay 
	   results due to different annotations of every radiologists, 
           to solve, ensemble boxes should be used to combine the bounding 
           boxes, the ensemble boxes means the that generated by taking the 
           union of all bounding boxes, while bounding boxes are generated 
           by different radiologist.
	-  To achieve this, different methods are tested and compared.
	   The methods tested are Non-maximum Suppression (NMS),
	   Soft-NMS, Non-maximum Weighted (NMW), and Weighted
	   Bboxes Fusion (WBF)

* Data Collection
	- Dataset consists of 15,000 postero-anterior chest xrays scans
	- 15,000 divided into to; the 15,000 for training and 
          3,000 for testing data
	- 13 Abnormalies (Aortic Enlargement, Atelectasis, Calcification,
	  Cardiomegaly ... **chck pdf**)
	- train.csv file that contains metadata for identofying photos label, 
	  like (image_id, class_name, class_id, ... **chck pdf**)

* Data Cleaning & Transformation
	- Steps:
		* Convert DICOM file format to JPEG
		* Remove unecessary class, that will be "No finding class"
		* Reduce the vales for x-min,y-min,x-max,y-max
	- The steps helped to make sure the data could be used for the
	  subsequent analysis and development.

* Data Analysis
	- Based on the dataset, 4394 images out of 18000 images contains
          abnormalities, with a total of 36,096 annotations, analyzed by 
          unique annotations counts per class, the outcome of the analysis, 
	  AORTIC ENLARGEMENT hast the highest count, for smallest that will
 	  be PNEUMOTHORAX; to set proper expectations the number of
	  annotations varies significantly. 
	- Image Example: Multiple abnormalities can exist within one image, 
	  and the location of each abnormality is clearly marked with a 
          bounding box and labeled with their respective class name.

* Development 
	- 4 different models/algorithms:
		* NMS - object detection to eliminate overlapping 
                        bounding bozes
		* SoftNMS - scores of the overlapping boxes will be 
                            loss/decayed
		* NMW - boxes are weighted based on their overlap
		* WBF - combines multiple detections from different 
			models or algorithms
	- Difference of these models is that the way they process or filter
          out overlapping bounding boxes. 
	- The code is designed to detect objects in an image by drawing 
 	  boxes around them. There are different algorithms used to 
          decide which boxes to keep and which to discard if they overlap 
	  with each other. Once the boxes are finalized, the code 
          compares them to the actual objects in the image and measures 
          how accurate the detection is. It then displays the results 
          visually by showing the original boxes, the detected boxes, 
          and any overlapping boxes.

* Evaluation
	- Metrics
		- evaluate the the methodology
		- 6 Metrics:
			* Precision - measures the proportion of 
                              true positive predictions out of all 
	 		      positive predictions
			* Recall - measures the precision in the groung truth
			* Average Precision - calculated by averaging the precision
                                      values at different recall levels.
			* F1 Score - hormonic mean of precision and recall, used to
                             balance the importance of precision and recall
                             in the evaluation of the algorithm
			* Average IoU - the mean of the maximum IoU or
                                Intersection over Union values between the
	                        predicted bounding boxes and the ground truth
                              - evaluate the accuracy of object localization.
			* Average Recall - mean of the recall values at different IoU 
				 - evaluate the ability of the algorithm to
                                   detect objects at different levels of IoU
                                   overlap.
         
===== Results and Discussion =====

* NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression)
	- high recall rate
	- good balance between precision and recall
	- high precision however, a moderate overlap with the ground 
		truth bounding boxes 
	- successfully removes redundant boxes by selecting the box
		with the highest confidence score

* Soft NMS
	- recall and F1 score are lower compared to NMS
	- precision remains good, however, the IoU value indicates
		lower overlap with the ground truth bounding boxes
	- these suggesting a less accurate localization of objects
	- does not eliminate overlapping boxes but assigns lower 
		confidence scores to them

* Non-Maximum Weighted
	- similar results to the NMS, except for the average of IoU
	- works similarly to WBF, but it does not modify the confidence 
		score and exhibits slightly lower performance
	- WBF not only removes duplicate

* WBF (Weighted Boxes Fusion)
	- this is the methods that outperformed the other three methods
	- it achieved the highes scores in terms of average recall,
		average F1 score, average precision, and average IoU
	- ability to leverage the strengths of different models boxes 
		but also merges them into a single fused box, leading
		to a change in box size

* Application of WBF
	- suitable methods for multiple boxing scenarios due to its high
		performance and consideration of all bounding boxes. 
		It gathered all boxes and fuses them together that 
		results a comprehensice representation of the objects. 
	- Enhance the accuracy because it modifies the confidence score
	- Abilities:
		* remove duplicates boxes
		* merging the overlapping boxes
		* adjust confidence scores contributions

===== CONCLUSION =====
By utilizing WBF, medical personnel can gain from
more accurate and efficient processing of chest X-ray images,
supporting better clinical decision-making.
